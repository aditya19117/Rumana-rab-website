Within 6 months, I noticed the improvement and could easily practice all the asanas and postures without any pain. Also, the various pranayamas and asanas during the course made me feel healthy and energetic. I must thank Rumana for all her help and in confirming my belief of limitless health and benefits of practicing yoga.",

I also had pain in hip and thigh joints. I started yoga sessions with Rumana 5 weeks ago. Now, I do not have any pain in my hip and thigh joints. It has completely vanished! The knee pain is 90% cured. I am really impressed that with a few yoga exercises, my pain has been cured. THANK YOU RUMANA!",
